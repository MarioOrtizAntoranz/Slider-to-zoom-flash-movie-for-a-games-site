Slider to zoom flash movie for a games site

<p>I was asked to propose a solution for the scaling of embedded flash movies with a 
slider and two buttons to zoom in and zoom out.</p>

<p>There was another requirement concerning the display of banners in both sides of the flash application. 
They would have to be visible at certain browser widths</p>

<p>The technologies used for this project were:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Media queries</li>
<li>SWF</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
</ul>
